//PSEUDO CODING ARHHDS-------------
// A start button that loads the trivia question object (with answers included in it)
// Start button also has to start the timer that delivers some amount of 
//milliseconds to finish guessing all of the questions

// "hard" or "advanced" game offers new pages for each question and starts a 
// new time with each page/question load

// questions are created in new divs, etc upon the click of "start" button.
// new divs for questions may not be necessary, can practice creating multiple
//

// so, in this way, the hard coding isn't in the HTML file but rather, in JS. 
// this is a little more interesting..

// need to find a way to keep track of which answers are "correct" and which
// are "wrong", the data-attribute covered in class might be a useful option

// some class designation, data attribute or something that isn't directly
// on the visual presentation (even if it's visible in the console).

//an on click event listener, where if button with correct answer 
//class is pressed then add a tally, and else tally the incorrect 
//answer group

//on button clicks, have the correct answers add an index position to a 
// variable, the incorrect answers will do the same to a different 
// variable
// the onclick event in each "correct" and "incorrect" answer will populate (i++) the relevant
// variable, the "finish" button (new idea as of this comment) will tally all of these and 
// .text display them in the div which displays correct answers
